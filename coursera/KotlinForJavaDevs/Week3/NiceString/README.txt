Programming Assignment:

A string is nice if at least two of the following conditions are satisfied:

It doesn't contain substrings bu, ba or be;
It contains at least three vowels (vowels are a, e, i, o and u);
It contains a double letter (at least two similar letters following one another), like b in "abba".
Your task is to check whether a given string is nice. Strings for this task will consist of lowercase letters only. Note that for the purpose of this task, you don't need to consider 'y' as a vowel.

Note that any two conditions might be satisfied to make a string nice. For instance, "aei" satisfies only the conditions #1 and #2, and ```"nn"` satisfies the conditions #1 and #3, which means both strings are nice.


My Solution:

Solved this problem by using regex. It's a great tool for this one.
